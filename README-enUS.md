## Motivation
Cabreira (*Portuguese pronunciation:* [['kabɾɐjɾa]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Portuguese)) is a tool made to expose the real impact of droughts in Brazil's northeastern region, all in a simple and accessible interface. For that, a new metric of climate vulnerability was created, joining multiple socioeconomic data and drought intensity metrics from [Monitor de Secas](http://monitordesecas.ana.gov.br/mapa) (literally, _Drought Monitor_).

There's already a heavy focus on natural and social issues driven towards major brazilian cities - e.g. São Paulo - and forests - e.g. Amazon rainforest. This specialized treatment favors a scenario of political and academic neglect for the northeast, as for its people, wealth and problems. Nature, on the other hand, does not neglect - over half of the disaster-related impacts in Brazil come from droughts:
